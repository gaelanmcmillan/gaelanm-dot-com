A variation on the [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem). To state the problem in knapsack terms, you can fit `k` items in your bag. Optimize the sum of their values.
The twist is the items are actual `m`-length segments of an array of values. This means if you choose the `i`th item to put in your bag, you can't choose the `i+p`th segments for `p` in `{1,2,...,m-1}`.
Basically choosing one segment excludes choosing all overlapping segments.

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. The key observation, which I'll credit to my friend Hoang for helping me see, is this:
For some `start` in `[0, number of segments]` and `remaining` in `[0, number of choices]`, the best `remaining`th choice for a segment from the range `[start, number of segments]`
is either ...
1. ... the segment at `start` PLUS the best `remaining - 1`th choice for a segment from the range `[start + segment width, number of segments]`, **OR**
2. ... the best `remaining`th choice for a segment from the range `[start + 1, number of segments]`

In the picture below, the green blob is the segment at `start`, the blue blob is the segment at `start + 1`, and the yellow squiggle represents
the bounds of the subproblem when we choose the green blob and recursively solve from `start + m`, `remaining - 1`.

Considering these two options for each `start` and `remaining` constitutes a recursive strategy for solving the problem. The dynamic programming step is to simply
cache the optimal sum for each `start` and `remaining` in the problem's state-space. 

We can preprocess the original array to get the sum of each segment in O(n). Caching results in a matrix `dp[remaining][start]` means we can recall solutions to subproblems in constant time. Therefore the complexity of this solution is O(number of segments * number of choices) or O((n-m+1) * k).

```cpp 
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

ll dp[5000][5000];

int main() {
	int n,m,k;
	cin >> n >> m >> k;

	vector<ll> a (n);
	for (auto& x : a) cin >> x;

	const int num_segments = n-m+1;

	for (int r = 0; r < k; ++r) {
		for (int c = 0; c < num_segments; ++c) {
			dp[r][c] = -1;
		}
	}

	// preprocessing -- precompute all m-length segment sums.
	// segment_from[i] = sum of m consecutive elements of a starting from i, a[i .. i+m-1]
	vector<ll> segment_from (num_segments, 0);
	ll running_sum = accumulate(a.begin(), a.begin()+m, 0LL);

	for (int i = 0; i < num_segments; ++i) {
		segment_from[i]=running_sum;
		running_sum -= a[i];
		running_sum += a[i+m];
	}

	// the optimal `i`th choice is either
	// ... the segment at `start` plus the optimal `i + 1`th choice
	//							~~ OR ~~
	// ... the optimal `i`th choice starting from `start + 1`
	function<ll(int,int)> pick_subseq = [&] (int start, int remaining) {
		if (start >= num_segments || remaining < 0) return 0LL;
		if (dp[remaining][start] != -1) return dp[remaining][start];
		ll alternative = pick_subseq(start+1, remaining);
		ll best_next = pick_subseq(start+m, remaining-1);
		dp[remaining][start] = max(alternative, segment_from[start] + best_next);
		return dp[remaining][start];
	};

	ll ans = pick_subseq(0, k-1);

	cout << ans << '\n';
