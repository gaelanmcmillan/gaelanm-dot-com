## Motivation
The year is 2023 and C++ has some new features in the mail. (Contrary to what the cover of this post might suggest, reflection is not one of them).
While many of the features are specialized tools that will let domain specialists pinpoint particular problems, there are some features that will
quietly improve the readability and ergonomics of the average programmer's C++ code.

One of those features is **Deducing `this`**. If you haven't heard of the feature, I highly recommend these talks
as a primer to get excited about the feature:
+ [How C++23 changes the way we write code - Timur Doumler - Meeting C++ 2022](https://youtu.be/QyFVoYcaORg?t=1184) â€” A long talk, but worth the time if you have it.
+ [Deducing this Patterns - Ben Deane - CppCon 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXf--bazhJw)

In this post I'm going to look at some code I wrote on LeetCode, rewrite it using C++23's **Deducing `this`**, and compare the two.
I won't be showing any cutting-edge applications of the **Deducing `this`** that weren't already considered by the authors of the feature.
I'm just taking the opportunity to get these new patterns "under my fingers"!
