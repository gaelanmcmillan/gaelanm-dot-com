      Experimental application for creating graphics in realtime based on the frequency content from an incoming audio stream.
      A Fast Fourier Transform is performed on an audio stream in real time, and the resulting complex numbers are split into "frequency buckets". Each complex sinusoid is plotted as a point in 2D space, with a short history of the previous frames points connected by lines.
      Specific musical notes give way to recognizable patterns. Pretty fun to watch, if you ask me!
