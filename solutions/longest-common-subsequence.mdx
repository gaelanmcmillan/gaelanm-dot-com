A classic dynamic programming problem. The idea here is to keep an m*n table `lcs` where `lcs[r+1][c+1]` holds the length of the longest common subsequence between `text1[:c]` and `text2[:r]`. This is an improvement over bruteforce, because when the `c`th character of `text1` is the same as the `r`th character of `text2`, we can simply extend whatever longest common subsequence existed up to `text1[:c]` and `text2[:r]`, rather than recalculating these values.

```cpp 
class Solution {
private:
    array<array<int, 1001>, 1001> lcs;
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        const int n = text1.length();
        const int m = text2.length();

        // the lcs between anything and an empty string is 0
        for (int r = 0; r < m; ++r) lcs[r][0] = 0;
        for (int c = 0; c < n; ++c) lcs[0][c] = 0;

        for (int r = 0; r < m; ++r) {
            for (int c = 0; c < n; ++c) {
                if (text1[c] == text2[r]) {
                    lcs[r+1][c+1] = lcs[r][c]+1;
                } else {
                    lcs[r+1][c+1] = max(lcs[r+1][c], lcs[r][c+1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return lcs[m][n];
    }
};
```
