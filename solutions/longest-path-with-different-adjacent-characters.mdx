Really rolls of the tongue, doesn't it? An editorial is in the works, but here's the code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPath(vector<int>& parent, string s) {
        const int n = parent.size();

        vector<int> childOf (n, -1),
                    siblingOf (n, -1),
                    lengthFrom (n, -1);

        // keep a flat, singly linked connection through the graph        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (s[i] != s[parent[i]]) {
                siblingOf[i] = childOf[parent[i]];
                childOf[parent[i]] = i;
            }
        }

        int longest = 0;

        const function<int(int)> traverse = [&] (int node) {
            // if the best length from this node is known, return it immediately
            if (lengthFrom[node] != -1) return lengthFrom[node];

            // we either treat this node as the root and take the two best of its branches,
            // or pass the best branch from this node up to its parent
            int rank_1 = 0, rank_2 = 0;

            for (int child = childOf[node]; child != -1; child = siblingOf[child]) {
                int val = traverse(child);

                if (val > rank_1) {
                    rank_2 = rank_1;
                    rank_1 = val;
                } else if (val > rank_2) {
                    rank_2 = val;
                }
            }

            longest = max(longest, 1 + rank_1 + rank_2);
            lengthFrom[node] = rank_1 + 1;
            return lengthFrom[node];
        };

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            traverse(i);

        return longest;
    }
};
