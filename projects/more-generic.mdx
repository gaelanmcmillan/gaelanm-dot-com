      This very website! A custom-designed, content-driven portfolio website made with React and Next.js.
      A work in progress. Responsive design is hard! The CSS is in desparate need of a rewrite, just to clean up the project structure.
      I explored `styled-components`, CSS modules, CSS-in-JSX, global SCSS... Learned a lot, but now it's time to cull.
      Features I'd like to add are: sorting solutions by tag, automated upload of future solutions, and some actual blog posts!
      (Writing something worth reading is hard. Kudos to anyone who tries.)
