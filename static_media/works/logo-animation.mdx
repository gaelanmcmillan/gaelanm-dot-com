      From README.md:

      ... The simplest way I saw to achieve this flipping illusion was by performing a point-to-point
      linear interpolation between the positions of each neighbouring parallelogram.
      So, in my second run, I first figured out how to calculate the points of each parallelogram
      based on the appropriate translation and rotation in the pattern. I then used these parallogram
      points to create parametrized animation functions so each flip can be performed smoothly in succession.
      Each animation function maps a value between zero and one to a point-to-point linear interpolation between two parallelogram geometries.
      The flipping illusion is achieved by lerping the "top" and "bottom" points of the origin parallelogram
      toward the "bottom" and "top" points of the destination parallelogram respectively...
