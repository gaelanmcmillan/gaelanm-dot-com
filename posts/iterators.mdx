# Implementing Iterators

## Motivation
If you want to make your classes and containers to play nicely with the `algorithm` and `numeric` header, then this article is for you.
One of my hobbies is using mini programming challenges ala *LeetCode* and *Codeforces* as an excuse to practice writing library code.
Does this help with interview prep? Perhaps not, but it sure is fun.

Satisfying the iterator concept as it us understood in the C++ standard template library requires jumping through some hoops.

## What We Need
+ `MyClass_iterator` and `MyClass_iterator_const`
+ Pre- and post- increment operators
+ The `begin` and `end` family
