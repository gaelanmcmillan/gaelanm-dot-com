We want to find out which words from `words` can be formed by concatenating existing words from `words`. One way to do this is to first build a trie from `words`, then
perform a recursive DFS on the trie to see if a given word can be formed by tracing the trie to a completed word, starting again from the root, and tracing down to the end of another word.

Complexity is O(n\*m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of a given word.
The trie approach is not necessarily very cache-friendly. We also spend a considerable amount of time allocating trie nodes even though the bounds of the problem are known up front.
Might be neat to figure out how to statically allocate a trie.

```cpp
struct Trie {
    array<Trie*, 26> next {};
    bool terminus = false;

    void add_word(const string& word) {
        Trie* curr = this;
        for (char letter : word) {
            if (curr->next[letter - 'a'] == nullptr) {
                curr->next[letter - 'a'] = new Trie();
            }
            curr = curr->next[letter - 'a'];
        }
        curr->terminus = true;
    }

    bool has_concatenated(const string& word) {
        const int n = word.length();
        function<bool(int,Trie*,bool)> rec = [&] (int start, Trie* curr, bool hasBranched) {
            for (int i = start; i < n; ++i) {
                if (curr->next[word[i] - 'a'] == nullptr) {
                    return false;
                }
                curr = curr->next[word[i] - 'a'];
                if (curr->terminus && i < n) {
                    // only valid if we branch at least once
                    if (i+1 == n && hasBranched) return true;
                    bool branch = rec(i+1, this, true);
                    if (branch) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
            return false;
        };

        return rec(0, this, false);
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(vector<string>& words) {
        Trie root {};
        for (const auto& word : words) {
            root.add_word(word);
        }
        vector<string> concatenated;
        for (const auto& word : words) {
            if (root.has_concatenated(word))
                concatenated.push_back(word);
        }
        return concatenated;
    }
};
