## Motivation
I spend a lot of time learning about the features of modern C++ through solving [small coding challenges](moregeneric.ca/solutions) or by watching conference talks.
Making a simple HTTP server in C++ is a chance for me to
  + Deepen my understanding of web technologies
  + Put some concepts of C++ software development into practice

## Process

### Architecture
What exactly are we creating:
TCP Server
