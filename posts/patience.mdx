### Summary
0. Introduce a difficult problem.
1. Create an generic implementation of [patience sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience_sorting).
2. Use our code to solve three variations of the *longest chain in a partially ordered set* problem.

### Motivation
Early last year while solving problems on Kattis, I came across a deceptively tricky [problem](https://open.kattis.com/problems/poklon).
If one were to judge the quality of a problem by the metric of "difficulty to understand" versus "difficulty to solve", this problem would be among the best I've seen.
The problem, named simply *Poklon* (Croation for "gift"), comes from the *Croatian Open Competition in Informatics 2007/2008, contest #4*.
The tricky part of Poklon is observing that it can be reduced to a simpler problem, the longest increasing subsequence problem.
Since solving this problem, finding programming problems that belong to the same family of problems is one of my favourite things.
### Introduction
I love a good puzzle. When I started programming, it was natural for me to gravitate toward programming puzzles.
I find solving competitive programming problems to be a fun way to apply the theoretical knowledge
one learns in a classical undergraduate Computer Science program. My favourite is puzzling over a problem only to discover that it falls into a class of familiar problems. With this comes the chance that one can reduce the problem to its most abstract form, and devise a generic solution to fit any specialization of the problem.

C++ is my preferred language for these sorts of problems. This is due in large part to its fantastic standard library algorithms. Early in my C++ journey, my friend Ahmad recommended a talk by Conor Hoekstra called "Algorithm Intuition".

```cpp main.cpp
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
int add (int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}
```

## Sections:
+ Intro
+ Longest Increasing Subsequence
+ Monotone Ordered Subsequence

Answer They're all reducible to finding the maximum length chain in a partially ordered set!
